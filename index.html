            <h3>it wouldn't be possible without</h3>
            <p>The takitapart framework is largely adapted from <a href="http://jonikorpi.com">Joni Korpi</a>'s 
                fantastic <a href="http://goldengridsystem.com">Golden Grid System</a>, with several SASS 
                mixin's to do the heavy math. Additional code from the <a href="http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/">
                Normalize.css</a> and <a href="h5bp.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> projects was also used.

                I had gone but a short distance further when what seemed to be an <strong>excellent trail</strong> opened up around the face of a <strong>high cliff</strong>. The trail was level and quite broad and led upward and in the general direction I wished to go.

                The cliff arose for <em>several hundred feet</em> on my right, and on my left was an equal and <em>nearly perpendicular drop</em> to the <a href="#">bottom of a rocky ravine</a>. I had followed this trail for perhaps a <em>hundred yards</em> when a sharp turn to the right brought me to the <a href="#">mouth of a large cave</a>.
