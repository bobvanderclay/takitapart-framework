The takitapart framework
========================
A SASS-based semantic, responsive, and fluid framework.

Usage
-----
A sample webpage using most of the features is included (index.html).
A [Compass](http://http://compass-style.org/) stylesheet is also used.
All the takitapart-framework SASS files are in the media/sass/takitapart directory.
To include the framework, copy the directory to your SASS folder, and include it in your stylesheet.

	@import "takitapart/takitapart";
